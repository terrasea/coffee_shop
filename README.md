# Coffee Shop

An example of a responsive Polymer Dart web app. It is designed to work in a mobile browser as well as desktop browsers.
It was originally an experiment with the flyweight design pattern, and turned into an exercise to see how I could make
this into a mobile web app for use in cafes for ordering coffee.  It was an experiment to also make it responsive, so it
displays and behaves differently in the browser and a mobile device.  I do not expect this to be fit for purpose, as 
I've never worked in a cafe.  However anyone is free to adapt and use this code to their heart's content.

## Usage

This is a standalone web app.  Coffees are added via code.
